      <h1> line test</h1>

      <p> pike have very sharp teeth that have a chance of breaking your line
         they are also very strong. I would recommened line from 17lbs test to 25lbs test.

      <h1>What lures to use</h1>

      <p> Pike will attack almost anything you throw at
          them but i find that large paddle tail baits tend to work the best.
